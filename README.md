# Royex-Technologies-.Net-Test-Project
I have completed this assesment according to Royex Technologies .Net Project Test Question Paper.

I have created this project on.Net 8 platform .So If you wanna run this project then you have to make sure weather your platform .Net 8 or not. If not you have to upgrade your platform.

* I have tried to build this project according to Clean Architecture Model
* On this project I used code first approach aslo configured data seeding by entity framework core library.Just apply the command "Update-Database" on your .Net package manager Console.That will create databsae with table and table data autometically. 
* Also I have implemented CQRS pattern using MediatR library.
* I used Mapster library for mapping object.
* I created a ER relationship diagram and Sql script for SQL Server Database.You can find it into 'Document' Folder.

That's all about my project.Thank you.
